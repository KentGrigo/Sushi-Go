# Sushi Go!

## What is this?
This repository contains an implementation of the card game Sushi Go!


## How to run?
The game is made in pure HTML and Javascript so just open `index.html` in a browser, and you're good to go.


## Status
The implementation is still work-in-progress so only the game mechanics and scoring function have been implemented.
Human-player interaction and a strategy for a computer player are still missing.

Currently, you can set up a game of 2-5 computer players.
The players will automatically play the first card in their hand.
They will play three rounds and will then be scored.
